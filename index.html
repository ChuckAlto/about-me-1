           Hello! My name is John Tucker.  Born in MT. Vernon W.A. in 1974, lived here in Washington, Texas, and Alaska during my formative   years.
           Joined the Army in 1992 straight out of highschool and served till 2013. I have a bit of ecletic background, anything from painting and upholstering Classic Cars and boats. To jumping out of airplanes and repelling out of helicopters. I like building new things, Fabricating sheet metal, fiberglass work,robots and building computers. 
           Ha just whatever catches my eye i guess. Went to trade school for car customization, In 2014 finished 2015 and had my own business till 2018.
           I'm an avid gamer and tech junky, but Boats are my passion, the picture to the left there is out on lake washington the weekend of the 4th.

           My goal is to Figure this stuff out, and try and find a decent job. Python is my end game, wich i will use to program my projects, and hopefully work from home so i have more time for said projects.

            So thats a little bit about me. Any questions you have I may or may not answer.
